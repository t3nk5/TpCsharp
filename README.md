### **Feedback on the Project**
I am not very proud of my project because I simply couldn‚Äôt fully commit to it. We had already done almost the same project in C++ last year. If I had to do it again, I would approach it differently and try to better optimize my code, as I feel my project is not optimized enough. C# is very practical because it‚Äôs a mix between JAVA, which I enjoy for its readability, and the performance of C/C++.
